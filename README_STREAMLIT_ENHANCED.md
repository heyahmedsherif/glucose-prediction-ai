## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Enhanced App Issues

**"Import Error: EnhancedGlucosePredictionPipeline" error:**
- Use `glucose_prediction_app_simple.py` (recommended)
- Ensure `train_enhanced_glucose_models.py` is in the same directory

**"Models directory not found" error:**
- Run `python train_enhanced_glucose_models.py` first
- Check that `glucose_prediction_models/` directory exists

**Plotly visualization errors:**
- Update plotly: `pip install plotly --upgrade`
- Clear Streamlit cache: `streamlit cache clear`

**Poor predictions:**
- Verify diabetic status selection matches your HbA1c
- Check that meal preset matches actual food consumed
- Ensure baseline glucose is reasonable for your status
